<h1>CHARACTER DECISIONS: LEYN M. RENTON</h1>
<p>As I (Sean/Mr. Savage) had no other place to add a spot for character decisions, I have added them to this page which I will update after every game.</p>
<h2>Session One: 3 DEC 2016<h2>
<h3>Day One</h3>
<p>Leo Sin brought a band of new people into the room. Among them, I note Culhwch, my protege. It does my heart good to see him after all of these years. As expected, we are not quite sure of what to make of each other except making do.</p>
<p>Following the debriefing and some banter, we head to a local tavern where Sir Flume is making merry with the other men there. Knowing his penchant for heroic stories, I play what I believe to be one of my best performances and try therein to soften his heart a bit toward my new... comrades. Upon completion of this performance, one of the more motley crew members makes a poor showing of himself and is asked out of the hall. Bugman continues to press on and work his way into the favor of Sir Flume while I play accompaniment. While words do soften the heart and any bard knows, music absolutely melts it. No moment must be miised.</p>
<p>Having successfully convinced Sir Flume of our cause, I remember the youth that from earlier and bring food for both he and his friend... what was her name.... Amati, I believe. Even the roughest among us shouldn't be left to starve, after all. It seems he anticipated a lecture from me, but I had no such designs and so I gave what I came to give and left. Someone new ended up in their company; I guess the occasion stray cat needs a home just the same. </p>
<h3>Day Two</h3>
<p>We attempt to obtain jobs going toward the city Leo Sin has indicated. In the process, we are split into groups, making it easier for our company to obtain jobs and then possibly come together later. My company, containing who I have termed the "Kitten Trio", Culhwch, and myself where able to easily obtain a job. Our reward and entertainment was watching the other team struggle to perform the same. I will note that with a chuckle.</p>
<p>We soon got on the road. The journey was 3 months long. Perhaps I might be able to catch up with Culhwch and ask him about, not only his newfound friends and the stories he has collected along the way, but also to find out about his drake and how he managed to come across so rare a creature.</p>
<h3>Month One</h3>
<p>The caravan is going swiftly enough, but the people here seem to be ill-acquainted with reconnaise missions. I spent a fair bit of time playing music to pass the time and seeing what I could see. So far, they've dropped some very interesting items and allowed a horse to die by not feeding it. What manner of person makes a three month journey without so much as considering feed for the animals? That aside, there seem to be very few animsls along this stretch of road. We've been traveling for weeks, but have seen nary a bird or any other beast. I find that somewhat interesting, but more disturbing. If something should happen to any of the other horses, we will be hard-pressed to continue our journey.</p>
<p>During the journey, we ran aground a man that seems to have had the same mission as we did, but he was found out. After making sure he was given proper attention, we moved on. That night, one of our comrades was nearly killed. He was taken away to be interrogated, but from what I heard back at camp, it didn't go well; negotiations rarely end with a gun shot. It quickly devolved into a brawl from there during which Culhwch displayed a fury I've not seem in all my years knowing him.</p>
<p>Our enemy is aware of us. May the goddess preserve us along these treacherous roads.</p>
<h3>Month Two</h3>
<p>I shall not be a happier man than when this mission is over. Just this day we were attack by a mad priest and a small band he was with. I've run into the occasional unsavory character, but they seemed to take a special liking to my blood for this battle. No matter, we managed to make it through intact. I attempted to stop a few of the knaves, but mayhaps my fury was a bit more powerful than anticipated; I meant to merely blow them away, but seemed to have channeled natures full fury instead.</p>
<p>Perhaps that moment was a prediction of things to come; later that evening proved to be taxing upon my patience. I looked for Culhwch only to find him taken aside with some battle. How do we manage to find everything to be distracted by? I cannot fathom, but one of the kittens decided that, after the battle, he would kill the only person we had to interrogate. I cannot fathom his reasoning, so I stopped him and confiscated the weapon, passing it to Bugman for keeping before returning to my camp. I understand there are other, more foolish antics that were recorded by the evening sky that night, but that's for those who were present.</p>
<p>I returned to the camp finding all in order. Culhwch followed to report his findings and I played music in the boughs of a nearby tree, keeping watch of the camp. My mood was as dark as the twi-lit sky. Should I chance upon Andrus again, I will rend his Lyre in twain; no one deserves the ability to tell a story when they are so quick to end them. I shall have to account for his other friends, but should I need to... I will. Otherwise, I fear to consider the cost we will pay for their continued foolishness.</p>
